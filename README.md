# 02-HW-Portfolio

# Build a Portfolio from scratch using what we knew to create a version similiar to the mock up that was given.

## Frustration kicked in trying to flex Css properties

# I reffered to old activities to try and complete, however in my attempt I was not successful.

# I will use my freetime to catch up on CSS formating in order to finish this assignment.
